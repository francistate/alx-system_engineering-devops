# Simple Web Stack Infrastructure

## Infrastructure Design for www.foobar.com

### Components:
1. **Server** (IP: 8.8.8.8)
   - Physical or virtual machine hosting all components

2. **Web Server (Nginx)**
   - Handles HTTP requests from users
   - Serves static content
   - Acts as reverse proxy to application server

3. **Application Server**
   - Processes dynamic requests
   - Executes application logic
   - Generates dynamic content

4. **Application Files (Codebase)**
   - Contains the website's source code
   - Business logic and application scripts

5. **Database (MySQL)**
   - Stores and manages application data
   - Handles data persistence

6. **Domain Name (foobar.com)**
   - Human-readable address for the website
   - DNS configured with www record pointing to 8.8.8.8

## Component Explanations:

**What is a server?**
A server is a computer system that provides services, data, or programs to other computers (clients) over a network.

**Role of domain name:**
The domain name provides a human-readable address that maps to the server's IP address through DNS resolution.

**DNS record type for www:**
The "www" in www.foobar.com is a CNAME record that points to the root domain, which has an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8.

**Role of web server:**
- Accepts HTTP requests from clients
- Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Forwards dynamic requests to application server
- Returns responses to clients

**Role of application server:**
- Executes application code
- Processes business logic
- Generates dynamic content
- Communicates with database

**Role of database:**
- Stores application data persistently
- Manages data integrity and consistency
- Provides data retrieval and storage services

**Server communication protocol:**
The server uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol to communicate with user computers requesting the website.

## Infrastructure Issues:

**Single Point of Failure (SPOF):**
- If the single server fails, entire website becomes unavailable
- Database, web server, and application server all on one machine

**Downtime during maintenance:**
- Deploying new code requires restarting services
- Server maintenance causes complete service interruption

**Cannot scale with traffic:**
- Single server has limited processing capacity
- No load distribution mechanism
- Performance degrades with high traffic volume
